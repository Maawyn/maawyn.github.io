I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. The point is that when I see a sunset or a <a href="#">waterfall</a> or something, 
for a split second it's so great, because for a little bit I'm out of my brain, and it's got nothing to do with me. 
I'm not trying to figure it out, you know what I mean? And I wonder if I can somehow find a way to maintain that mind stillness.

Artista, las historias que pienso las escribo, las imagenes que surgen en mi mente las dibujo y las experiencias que no he podido dibujar.
